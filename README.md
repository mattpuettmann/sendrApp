# sendrApp

WHERE WILL YOU SEND IT TODAY??

SENDR allows users to track local weather data to determine the best nearby locations for related activity.
The app will take in weather data (Dark Sky or World Weather Online api, still sorting which) and print associated data on a map using the Google map api.

MVP:
1. App features full CRUD ability for users.
2. App features weather data (past, current conditions, imminent forecast).
3. App features interactive Google map.
4. Basic CSS styling

Nice To Have:
1. Login/Logout/User authentication
2. Modes: where will SENDR send you? If conditions meet ski requirements, display ski locations on map. If conditions meet nice day requirements, display hiking locations on map.
2. Up to 4 modes, need to research outdoors api's.
3. React/bootstrap styling.
4. Fully mobile responsive.
